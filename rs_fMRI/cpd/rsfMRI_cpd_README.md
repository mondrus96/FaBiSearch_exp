# FaBiSearch Resting-State fMRI - Change Point Detection

Each folder contains the resting-state fMRI change point detection results - folders Visit2 and Visit3 relate to the second and third scanning sessions for this data set. For each scanning session, there is an associated .sh and .Rout with the same naming convention - these are the shell scripts for SLURM (used to run on a remote cluster) and console logs, respectively. With SLURM, there are associated SLURM .out files which are related to the batch job. Finally, the .rda files contain the results for change point detection.
