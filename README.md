# FaBiSearch experiments

This repository contains the code and experiments for "Factorized Binary Search: change point detection in the network structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series" (Ondrus et al. 2022, 	arXiv:2103.06347 [stat.ME]). The method uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to model signals, and a novel binary search based segmentation, depicted below:

## Simulations

`simulations` contains simulated data experiments and comparisons to NCPD (Network Change Point Detection). We find our method is generally superior to NCPD.

## Resting-state fMRI experiments

`rs_fMRI` contains the code for resting-state experiments, for which we investigate test-retest reliability in the [NYU CSC dataset](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/nyu_trt). An example of the estimated dynamic network structures is shown below, for subject 1 during visit 2.

## Task-based fMRI experiments

`tb_fMRI` contains the task-based experiments, where subjects are [reading Chapter 9 of *Harry Potter and the Sorcererâ€™s Stone*](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmri/plosone/). We find change points are concentrated around key plot twists.
