# FaBiSearch_exp

This repository contains the code and experiments for "Factorized Binary Search: change point detection in the network structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series" (Ondrus et al. 2022, 	arXiv:2103.06347 [stat.ME]).

It is organized into the following main folders:

rs_fMRI - this contains the resting-state experiments

tb_fMRI - this contains the task-based fMRI experiments

simulations - this contains the simulations used to validate FaBiSearch, as well as compare it to NCPD (Network Change Point Detection)
