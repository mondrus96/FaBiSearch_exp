# Simulation Experiments

This folder is organized into the following sub-folders:

analysis - contains the scripts to run, and results from, analysis of the change point detection as well as stationary network estimation procedures

fabisearch - contains the functions for and results from, change point detection and stationary network estimation in simulations for FaBiSearch

NCPD - contains the functions for and results from, change point detection in simulations for NCPD

sharedfunctions - this contains the functions (related to generating simulations) which are shared and used by both fabisearch and NCPD during the simulation experiments.
